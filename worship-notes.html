  grace church<The Root of Doom and the Hope of the Nations>
  Obadiah 1-21
  Obadiah=means 'servant' or 'worshiper.'
  we don't know who obadiah or when he wrote the bible. some people say he probably wrote it after the fall and bablyon exile.
  Adom=all prideful humanity that goes against God.
  Edom=all humanity.
  Good news of obadiah=pride and arrogance would be done.
  sometimes, God brings his judgements before the day of the Lord. THe day of the Lord is terrible day for the people who are arrogant and pride. 
  God takes sins seriously.
  God's judgement comes against pride which is the root of all sins and it works in anxiety and doesn't heal your soul.
  Jesus=opposite of pride.
    
  
  NCBC<praying fervently and faithfully>
  James 5:13-18
  God use suffering to do something.
  1)when we pray to God, we must come to him in desperate need.
  praise=fill with desperate cry(lyrics).
  one of the reason you don't pray=you don't believe God.
  2)we must desperately seek and boldly ask the Lord for his will to be done.
  when you are sick, ask someone to pray for you.
  God use our sickness for his purpose. he's making us to come(pray) to God. he has something to teach us through the sickness.
  3)we must humbly pray fervently and faithfuly, believing jesus can do what we cannot. 
  sometimes, sickness is result of your sins. but God is not punishing you. you got sick just because you are sinful. let's confess our sin today.
  confessing our sin is God's way to heal us. 
  pray for miracle of salvation.


  Grace Church<What does the Lord require of you?>
  VARIOUS SELECTIONS FROM MICAH
  WHat does the Lord require of you? = Do we seek what God wants us to do? <-really important question!
  This question's answer is not sacrifice, money...etc. The answer is live a life with justice and humbly walk with your God. And Jesus did it!
  burnt offering = give our whole to god.
  We have to give something that is more valuable than money, which is our time.


  NCBC<Praying For True Revival>
  2 CHRONICLES 7:11-20
  God didn't commend David to build temple. Because he is the warior. So God let Solomon, David's son to build temple.
  Temple = place where God chose to do worship, pray and receive sacrifice. 
  1)BEFORE TRUE REVIVAL BEGINS, PEOPLE MUST RESPOND TO THE WORD OF GOD.
  If there is no word of God, then no revival.
  Word of God -> repentance.
  2)IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE TRUE REVIVAL, WE MUST SEE TRUE REPENTANCE.
  Revival = death to life. ex) non-christian to christian.
  3)TRUE REVIVAL DEMANDS PERSISTENT FRUIT OF DESPERATE PRAYER AND REPENTANCE.
  Persistent = Keep growing, keep doing it.
  We should repent everyday, not just one time. 
  If you don't repent everyday, that means you are not aware of how sinful yourself. 
  If you truly been revived by Jesus, there should be transfiguration in your life.
